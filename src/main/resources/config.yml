# Should doubling down be enabled (double your bet amount but forced to stand after drawing 1 more card)
enable-double-down: true

# If double down is enabled, and a person doubles down without enough funds to cover the cost of a loss,
# should they still be rewarded the 2x multiplier?
# E.g. player A bets all $100 they own, they then double down making the bet $200, they then lose and hence lose
# $200. However, a lot of economies do not use negative balances so they would really only lose $100.
# I'd recommend keeping this false unless your economy allows for players to have negative balances
